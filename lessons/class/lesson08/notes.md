## Building Effective Classifiers

### Training error
	Training error is the average loss over the training data

### Test / generalization error
	The expected error over an independent test sample drawn from the same distribution as that of the training data.

### OOS error

### N-Fold Cross-validation

## KNN classification

### Euclidean distance function
